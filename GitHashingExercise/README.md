This is a Hashing Exercise where i pass the last 4 digits of my student ID to a bash script, and it returns their hashed version, according to the SHA256 hashing algorithm. The SHA256 algorithm is a one-way transformation, meaning that if I hash the input, there is no way to retrieve it again just from the output alone
